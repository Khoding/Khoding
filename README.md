### His story
When he was young, Bruce's parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, the richest people in Gotham, Owners of Wayne Enterprises, The Wayne Manor (outside of Gotham), and the 2 tallest towers in the city (Wayne Plaza and Wayne Tower (Wayne Enterprise's Building)) got killed in a small street (that was renamed *Crime Alley* after this event because the Wayne were the future of the city) after they left a theater with Bruce. He saw everything.

#### How he became Batman [^1]
1. He then trained his whole life to become something... different... one day he saw a bat entering in his room, and became Batman.
2. When he was young, he was playing with his friend Rachel and he fell in a pit, tons of bats flew around him, he was then extremely scared of bats, he used that fear as a way to become a Symbol for Gotham, The Batman.

### Alfred Pennyworth <a id="alfred">
His devoted butler, he loves Bruce more than anything, he raised him after his parents died.

![Alfred Pennyworth](https://khodok.xyz/src/img/batmanMD/alfred.jpg)
He was a special agent in MI6 during WW1 (one of the best) and still is an excellent fighter (considering his age), he then found out that the Queen was kind of using them as a tool to get what she wanted, and that it wasn't for good reasons, so he left the MI6 and wandered a while until he met [Thomas Wayne](#thomas), who became one of his best friends, Thomas asked him to be his butler, and he accepted.

He also works with him as his ~~secretary~~ associate, he tries to find stuff about the people Batman fights during night, without him, Batman would have died 150 times already.

They are usually agreeing about what to do, but sometimes Alfred acts more as a dad to Bruce, and Batman just wants to do the job, whatever it takes, even if has to die for it (like stopping the explosion of Ace Chemicals, a chemical laboratory that Scarecrow took over to make it a huge bomb).

[//]: # (Add some stuff about Alfred)

### Selina Kyle <a id="cat">
![Selina Kyle](https://khodok.xyz/src/img/batmanMD/catwoman.jpg)
Most commonly known as Catwoman (because of her costume, her extreme agility and the fact that she's really slim (And also the fact that she was called *Cat* as a kid)).
Selina Kyle is an antiheroine known to be Batman's girl [^1] (even though he never get engaged with anyone, not even with her [^4]).

She lived in the street as a kid and she claims that made her the woman of character she is today. She is now the *best stealer* in Gotham, dressed as a cat, she steals expensive stuff from all over the city, in museums (she knows a couple of them that are poor and defenceless, but then again, she also knows a couple of hotels), jewlery stores, etc.

Batman often works with her to save the city because she's a talented fighter and really stealth (stealthness is what makes Batman a good Hero, his enemies never see him which means they can't stop him).

### Jim Gordon <a id="jim">
**The** Commissioner Gordon, one of Bruce's best friend and also one of Batman's most trusted partner.
Jim gets in contact with Batman by using the Bat-Symbol, that huge light-spot with a Bat in the middle that creates a huge Bat on the sky, that way Batman knows he's needed.

Sometimes Batman also needs Gordon, and he does the same (if he can't find him (which is rare), most of the time he comes sneaky in his back and asks him what he needs, talks a few minutes and leaves while Gordon doesn't watch, Gordon often reacts to this behaviour with *Every damn time*).

They look like *Crazy-Ass Ninjas* (They wear dark, colored or gray-ish clothes that kinda look like what Jedi wear, and they have Samurai Swords, they speak arabic and often live on a temple on top of huge mountains next to a cliff called Nanda Parbat)

The most important people in this league are Ra's and his daughters, Talia and Nyssa.

## Joker <a id="joker">
***This one has a H2 Header because he deserves it.***

| Real Name | Main Role | First Apparition |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Unknown [^5] | Batman's biggest enemy | _[Batman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(comic_book) "Batman (comic book)")_ #1 (April 25, 1940) |

### Who is he ?
Joker is Batman's most recurrent enemy, his first apparition was in the first Batman dedicated Comic Book, and since then he's still the main.

### Why is Joker still the main villain after nearly 80 years ? (ETA Feb. 2020)
Joker is often called one of the best villains of all time, a title that Darth Vader also gets a lot, why ? Because he's mysterious, crazy, he's the only one Batman really struggles with, and he's also the only one Batman ever killed (if we say that running over someone with an electrocuting Batmobile at 100 kmh doesn't kill).

Joker believes Batman is his only reason to live, that's why he never killed him, and that's also why he never tries to know **WHO** Batman really is, he knows that if he unmasks him, he won't be able to be The Batman anymore, so he won't have any reason to continue to live.

He's different than any other villain in any other universes of any type of entertainment, everyone wants to know who Superman is, everyone wants to know who Green Arrow is, everyone wants to know who The Flash is, everyone wants to know who his enemy is, but not Joker, that's one reason that makes him so interesting.

Other villains don't care who their enemy is, Scarecrow for example doesn't care who he is, but he still tries to unmask him, so people can see that _There is no Savior, no more Hope, no... more... **BATMAN !!**_ [^6]
